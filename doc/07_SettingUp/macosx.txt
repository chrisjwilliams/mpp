## Setting Up a Mac OSX (Darwin) machine for MPP ##

The Mac OSX license conditions do not allow you to install it as a virtual machine, and
so the unionfs method is the only option. To set this up you will need a clean disk image.
This is easiest provided by partitioning your hard drive, and installing the OS direct to
this partition. Apart from system updates, this partition should never be used in a write
mode, and so it may be a good idea to mount it read only.

Now you have two installs - one a pristine mac and your main startup disk which you will
use to boot up from under normal circumstances.

# set up ssh #
Both images must have the same ssh host key:
copy the key files from one installation to another e.g.

sudo cp /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/etc/ssh_* /etc

# the mpp user account #
On your start disk, create a user in the usual way (e.g. mpp_user). Make sure this user
has system administrator priviledges.

# enable wake on lan #
In System Preferences, go to "Energy Saver," click on the "Options" tab, and make sure "Wake for Ethernet network administrator access" is selected.
