## Welcome to MPP the Multi-Platform Packager ##

This aim of this book is to enable the reader to successfully set up
and use a full packaging environment. 

It is split into three main parts:

Part I : Using the mpp tool
       - The basic ideas behind mpp
       - The build, test, and publish process 
       - building packages
       - publishing packages

Part II : Setting up a Packaging Environment
       mpp requires fairly extensive systems work to set up 
       and this section is designed to help you get up and running quickly.

Part III : Extending mpp
       Mpp is designed to be extended with plugin modules. This section
       covers all you need to know to develop extra functionality.
