## [packager] section ##

In general each platform will have a standard package management system for dowloading
and installing software. This is often in two parts:
1) the publisher client, which manages downloading of packages and their depndencies
2) the installation which actually takes these packages and unpacks them onto the system

In some cases there are more than one option for one or both of these roles.
The function of the [packager] section is to specify these toolchains.
The "type" keyword specifies the publisher client and the
"packageType" keyword specifies the packages used.

e.g. on openSuse 11.1 platform the packages used are rpm's. The zypper tool is the publisher
client.

[packager]
type=zypper
packageType=rpm
