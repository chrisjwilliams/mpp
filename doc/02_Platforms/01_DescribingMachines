## Describing the Computing Environment ##

This section deals with the issues of describing different computing environments 
to mpp to enable it to do its work. Information is broken down in two main sections:

1) Platform Specific
   Describes general features of the Operating System, such as the names
   of packages required to meet dependencies, locations of the main system
   libraries etc.
2) Machine Specific
   Actual installation specific information such as the ip address of a specific
   machine and how to start it up.

## Machine Specific Data ##

Configuration Directory: PackageManager/Platforms

For each machine available to mpp, a seperate file must be provided. The name
of the file will be the name that the machine will be referred to by mpp.
Note that the machine has to be configured for use by MPP, to allow it to log on 
and act as administrator when required (See chapter TODO )

Example 1 : Machine on the local network
----------------------------------------
     This describes a Mac OSX machine on the local network named "my_mac". By providing
the internet cards mac address and your lan's broadcast address in the network section you 
allow mpp to try and start the machine through the wake on lan protocol.

[system]
arch=i386
platform=macos_x_darwin

[workspace]
dir=/Users/mpp_user/mpp_work

[network]
hostname=my_mac
login=mpp_user
mac=00:78:9d:77:77:6c
broadcast=163.1.125.255

[packager]
type=macport


Example 2 : VMWare Server
-------------------------
     This describes a ubuntu 8.04 platform that can be started up on demand on
     the local host using vmware server.

[system]
bootDelay=80
arch=i386
platform=ubuntu_8_04

[vmware]
id=[standard] Ubuntu_8_04_32-bit/Ubuntu_8_04_32-bit.vmx
server=https://localhost
port=8333
username=myvmwareuser
passwd=mysecretpassword

[network]
ip=172.16.89.61
login=mympploginaccountname

[packager]
type=apt

Example 3 : ESXi Server using the RCLI toolset
----------------------------------------------
     This describes a ubuntu 8.04 platform that can be started up on demand using
     a remote vmware hypervisor (ESXi) service.

[system]
bootDelay=80
arch=i386
platform=ubuntu_8_04

[vmware]
id=[datastore1] Ubuntu_8_04_32-bit/Ubuntu_8_04_32-bit.vmx
serverType=esx
server=myesxserver.mydomain
port=902
username=myvmwareuser
passwd=mysecretpassword

[network]
ip=172.16.89.61
login=mympploginaccountname

[packager]
type=apt

Example 4 : ESXi Server using ssh
---------------------------------
     Where the use of RCLI is not appropriate and the ESXi server has been enabled for ssh
login. This describes a fedora_11 64bit machine hosted on the ESXi server myESXiBox.

[vmware]
id=208
serverType=ESXiSSH
server=myESXiBox

[system]
bootDelay=45
arch=x86_64
platform=fedora_11

[network]
hostname=
ip=192.168.97.51
login=vmware

[packager]
type=yum
packageType=rpm

Note that the myESXiBox has to have its own platform description file :

# The ESXi host server platform description file
[system]
arch=i386
platform=esx
bootDelay=20

[network]
hostname=myESXiBox
login=root
mac=00:24:60:9c:d6:f4
broadcast=192.168.99.255
