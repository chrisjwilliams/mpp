## Defining Publication Servers ##

Packages can be made available through one or more servers. Different 
servers will be needed for the different architectures supported.

Each server needs to be described to mpp in the main configuration file (mpp.conf). 

## The [publisher::server_name] section ##

Each section beginning with the publisher keyword defines a server. 

e.g. This section defines an apt publisher called oxford_apt. 
(Apt is a system used by debian distributions) 

[publisher::oxford_apt]
url=http://oxfordpublicationserver/apt
type=apt
root=/var/www/apt
