## Defining Publications ##
A publication defines a collection of repositores,servers, and conventions that 
are to be used to support one or more software products. Mpp allows you to 
support multiple publications.

## Publication configuration files ##

### The [publication] section ###
Generic information about the publication:
name        : The name of the publication (defaults to the file name)
description : A brief description of the publication
url         : a url for the publication

### Publication Repositories. The [repositories] section ###
Packages can be made available through one or more repositories. Different 
repositores will be needed for the different architectures supported.

Each repository needs to be described to mpp in the main configuration file (mpp.conf).
The repositories to be associated with the publication are then provided as a 
list of these repository names.

## Defining platform specifics. The [platform] section ##
For each supported platform, a [platform::<platform_name>] section is 
required. Allowed values under this section are:

versionMangler : Define a version string mangler to override the default associated with the
                 repository type.
repository     : define the repository to be associated with this platform

## The [publisher::server_name] section ##

Each section beginning with the publisher keyword defines a server. 

e.g. This section defines an apt publisher called oxford_apt. 
(Apt is a system used by debian distributions) 

[publisher::oxford_apt]
url=http://oxfordpublicationserver/apt
type=apt
root=/var/www/apt
